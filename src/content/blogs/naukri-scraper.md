## Introduction

Job hunting often involves refreshing the same pages endlessly. **Naukri Scraper** automates the collection of job postings, saving them to a CSV for easy analysis.

---

## The Challenge

Dynamic websites like Naukri load content via JavaScript, making standard requests insufficient. This project likely uses **Selenium** or **Playwright** to render pages before scraping.

---

## Tech Stack

-   **Language**: Python
-   **Output**: CSV / Excel

---

## Conclusion

A powerful tool for aggregating market data or speeding up personal job searches.
