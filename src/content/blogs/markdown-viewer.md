## Introduction

Markdown is supposed to be simple. In reality, the tools around it often aren’t. Switching between editor and preview, dealing with broken formatting, or converting Word and PDF files into usable Markdown wastes more time than it should.

This post introduces **Maarkdown Viewer**, a web app built to make Markdown editing and conversion straightforward again.

### The Problem

Most Markdown workflows suffer from a few common issues:

- No reliable live preview while writing
- Poor or nonexistent DOCX and PDF conversion
- Heavy desktop apps or cluttered interfaces
- Too much setup for something that should be quick

For anyone working with documentation regularly, this friction adds up fast.

### The Solution

**Maarkdown Viewer** is a clean, browser-based Markdown tool designed around real-world needs.

#### Live Preview

A true side-by-side editor and preview.

You write Markdown on the left and see the rendered output on the right, updating instantly as you type. No guessing. No context switching.

#### DOCX & PDF to Markdown Conversion

Upload a Word document or PDF and convert it directly into Markdown.

The app preserves headings, structure, and formatting so you don’t have to rewrite content manually or deal with messy copy-paste results.

#### Customization

- Light and dark themes
- Font customization
- Minimal, distraction-free layout

Everything is designed to stay out of your way while you write.

### Built with Modern Tech

Maarkdown Viewer is built using a modern frontend stack:

- **React** for the UI
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for fast builds and reloads
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn-ui** for polished components

The focus is on speed, clarity, and maintainability.

## Who This Is For

- Developers writing READMEs and docs
- Technical writers converting legacy documents
- Students taking structured notes
- Content creators drafting blog posts
- Anyone who prefers clean, portable text formats

If Markdown is part of your workflow, this tool fits naturally.

## Why I Built It

As a data engineer, I spend a lot of time with documentation. Existing tools felt fragmented and slow, especially when dealing with older Word or PDF files.

I wanted one tool that handled writing and conversion without friction. Maarkdown Viewer is the result.
