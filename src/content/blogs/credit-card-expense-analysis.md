## Introduction

Understanding where money goes is the first step to financial freedom. With credit card statements often being cluttered and hard to read, spotting trends can be difficult.

This project, **Credit Card Expense Analysis**, dives into raw financial data to extract meaningful insights about spending habits.

---

## The Problem

Credit card statements are great for seeing *what* you bought, but terrible for seeing *how* you spend.

- Which category consumes the most budget?
- How does spending fluctuate month-over-month?
- Are there high-frequency comparisons that go unnoticed?

Without visualization, these answers are buried in rows of numbers.

---

## The Solution

This project uses **Excel** to clean, process, and visualize credit card transaction data.

### Key Features

- **Categorization**: Transactions are grouped into meaningful categories (Food, Travel, Utilities, etc.).
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualized monthly spending trends to identify seasonal spikes.
- **Merchant Insights**: Identified top merchants and recurring payments.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs to represent financial data intuitively.

---

## Conclusion

By turning raw transaction rows into interactive dashboards, this project provides a clear view of financial health, enabling better budgeting and financial decisions.
