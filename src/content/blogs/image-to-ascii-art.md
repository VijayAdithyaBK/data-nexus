## Introduction

ASCII art is a nostalgia trip to the early days of computing. This project uses Python to turn high-res images into text-based masterpieces.

---

## The Logic

The script resizes input images, maps pixel grayscale values to a set of ASCII characters (like `@`, `#`, `.`), and outputs the result to a text file.

---

## Tech Stack

-   **Language**: Python
-   **Libraries**: PIL (Pillow) for image processing.

---

## Conclusion

A fun project that explores image manipulation at the pixel level.
