## Introduction

Managing subscriptions, deliveries, and billing for a newspaper agency involves moving parts that spreadsheets handle poorly.

The **Newspaper Agency** project is a full-stack web application designed to digitize these operations.

---

## The Architecture

The system is split into two distinct services:
1.  **Frontend**: A responsive user interface for agents and admins.
2.  **Backend**: A robust API handling logic and database communication.

---

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React (Vite) + TailwindCSS
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Django) or Node.js (inferred)
-   **Database**: SQL

---

## Key Features

-   **Subscription Management**: Track which customer gets which paper.
-   **Billing**: Generate monthly bills based on subscription rates.
-   **Delivery Routing**: Organize customer lists for delivery boys.

## Conclusion

By decoupling the frontend and backend, this project ensures scalability and maintainability, providing a solid foundation for digitizing traditional offline businesses.
