## Introduction

Retail data is the lifeblood of commerce. Analyzing it helps businesses understand trends, optimize stock, and target the right customers.

The **Retail Sales Analysis** project is a comprehensive guide to using SQL for data exploration and reporting.

## The Problem

Raw sales data is often messy and massive. Without the right tools, answering simple questions like "Who are my top 5 customers?" or "Which month had the best sales?" becomes a nightmare.

## The Solution

Using a synthesized retail dataset, I built a SQL workflow to clean, explore, and analyze the data.

### Key Insights

- **Sales Trends**: Identified peak sales months (November) and shifts (Afternoon/Evening).
- **Customer Behavior**: Segmented customers by gender and spending habits.
- **Product Performance**: Ranked categories like 'Clothing' and 'Beauty' by revenue.

### SQL Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing null values and standardizing formats.
- **Aggregation**: `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT` to summarize metrics.
- **Window Functions**: `RANK()` to find the best performing months relative to others.
- **Date Functions**: `EXTRACT` to break down timestamps into shifts (Morning/Evening).

## Conclusion

This project serves as a perfect starting point for anyone looking to break into data analytics, proving that simple SQL queries can solve complex business problems.
