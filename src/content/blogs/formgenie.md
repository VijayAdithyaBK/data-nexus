## Introduction

Forms are everywhere. Checkouts, job applications, admin dashboards, test environments. And somehow, we’re still typing the same details again and again.

Browser autofill helps sometimes. Password managers help a bit. But neither really understands forms, especially when field names change or custom data is involved.

This is where **FormGenie** comes in.

---

## The Problem

Most form-filling tools fall into one of two buckets:

- Too basic to handle anything beyond name and email
- Too heavy, opaque, and overreaching for simple autofill tasks

On top of that, field names are rarely consistent.  
"First Name" becomes "Given Name".  
"Email" becomes "User ID".

Autofill breaks. Time gets wasted.

---

## The Solution

**FormGenie** is a lightweight browser extension that intelligently fills forms using context, not brittle rules.

### Smart Field Matching

FormGenie doesn’t rely on exact field names.

It analyzes labels, attributes, placeholders, and surrounding context to figure out what each field represents. You define the data once, and it finds the right place to put it.

Flexible. Accurate. Fast.

---

### Custom Data Library

You’re not limited to predefined profiles.

Add any field you want.  
Give it aliases.  
Reuse it across any website.

Examples:
- Discord username
- Internal test IDs
- Alternate emails
- Temporary addresses

FormGenie remembers everything so you don’t have to.

---

### Privacy First by Design

Your data stays yours.

- Stored locally on your device
- No cloud sync
- No tracking
- Fully open source

You can inspect the code and see exactly what’s happening.

---

### Instant Autofill

No menus.  
No buttons.

Press **Alt + Shift + F** and the entire form fills instantly.

---

## Built with Performance in Mind

FormGenie is intentionally simple and fast.

- **Vanilla JavaScript** for minimal overhead
- **Manifest V3** for modern browser security
- **Chrome and Firefox** support
- **Smart heuristics** to understand real-world forms

It stays invisible until you need it.

---

## Who This Is For

- Developers and QA engineers testing forms repeatedly
- Job seekers filling out multiple applications
- Power users managing custom datasets
- Anyone tired of retyping the same information

If forms are part of your routine, this tool earns its place.

---

## Why I Built It

As a developer, I spend a lot of time testing sign-up flows, checkout pages, and admin panels. Existing tools were either too limited or tried to do too much.

I wanted something focused. Something I could control. Something that handled my custom test data without friction.

FormGenie is the result.
