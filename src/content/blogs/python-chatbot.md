## Introduction

Chatbots are the "Hello World" of AI applications. They combine logic, state management, and interaction.

This **Chatbot Project** is a Python implementation designed to handle basic conversational flows.

---

## Features

-   **Conversational Loop**: Continuous interaction until exit command.
-   **Environment Management**: Uses virtual environments (`venv`) for dependency isolation.
-   **Extensible**: Modular structure (`bot.py`) allowing for easy addition of new intents.

---

## Tech Stack

-   **Language**: Python 3
-   **Libraries**: Standard libraries + project specific requirements.

---

## Conclusion

A simple yet effective demonstration of how to build interactive command-line agents in Python.
